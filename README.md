# Desineer
Desineer is a VR-supported experimental application developed to examine the different possibilities of space production in line with this purpose. 
The name of the program was produced by distorting the word "design", which is the English equivalent of design, as a reference to the reduction of space production 
to project design today. The program was developed using the Unreal game engine. Its interface consists of a virtual environment reminiscent of 3D game spaces.
In this environment, there are interactive tools such as surfaces and meshes used for space production. In order not to limit the production of space as a visual and 
graphic-based activity, light source and sound (audio source) elements have also been added to these tools. With using these tools, users can produce experimental 
spaces as they wish.
